# skinning_renderer
This is OpenGL renderer for researchers who are designing neural nets to infer skin weights of given 3D model.

## Installation
Libraries below should be installed before running.
  1. assimp
  2. glfw
  3. glm
  
## Running
I tested with Ubuntu 18.04 with inputs of collada files (both of Ground Truth and prediction models)

If you want to your other collada files, edit main.cpp.
